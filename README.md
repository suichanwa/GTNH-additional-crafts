# GTNH Additional Crafts

GTNH Additional Crafts is a Minecraft 1.7.10 addon for GregTech: New Horizons focused on machine behavior patches and recipe adjustments.

## What This Mod Adds

- Patches the Large Combustion Engine (LCE) to support Dinitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4) as an oxidizer.
- Adds an LCE overclock mode toggle (screwdriver right-click) with configurable output and efficiency scaling.
- Adds support for 16A dynamo hatches on the patched LCE.
- Patches KekzTech SOFC MK1 so optional Helium usage reduces Oxygen and fuel consumption.
- Adds Large Chemical Reactor recipes for:
  - `Oxygen + Nitrogen + IC-9 -> Nitric Oxide`
  - `Nitric Acid -> Dinitrogen Pentoxide + Hydrogen`
- Removes the matching regular Chemical Reactor Nitric Oxide recipe.
- Registers a Dinitrogen Pentoxide fluid entry if one is not already present.
